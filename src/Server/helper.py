    Each task includes a heading, description, duedate, type, and color. Considering all these tasks, generate a detailed plan that helps the user complete them productively without missing any due dates. The plan should focus on:

    Task Ordering: Determine the order in which tasks should be completed based on their type and due dates.
    Methodology:
    Prioritization: Prioritize tasks by their type (e.g., personal, work, study) and due dates.
    Task Breakdown: Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks if necessary.
    Execution: Provide a step-by-step method for tackling each task, ensuring productivity and efficiency.
    Provide the user with a clear and actionable plan that includes:

    A prioritized list of tasks with an explanation for their order.
    Specific steps for breaking down and completing each task.
    Any additional tips for maintaining focus and managing time effectively.

    Today's date: {today}

Analyze the video interview and provide a detailed description of the interviewee's performance. 
The analysis should include the following parameters, each measured out of 10:

1. Vocabulary: Assess the range and appropriateness of terms used by the interviewee.
2. Confidence Level: Evaluate the interviewee's steadiness, tone, and lack of hesitation.
3. Engaging Ability: Determine how well the interviewee captures and maintains the audience's attention.
4. Speaking Style: Review the clarity, coherence, and expressiveness of the interviewee's speech.

I want to become an expert in {domain} within a year. Currently, I am a beginner, and it is {today} today. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step, task-based roadmap that spans the entire year, starting from today, to help me achieve my goals in the {domain} domain.

The roadmap should include at least 50 tasks covering the entire year, organized into phases:

1. **Foundational Concepts (First 3 Months):** Focus on building a strong understanding of the basics of {domain}.
2. **Intermediate Skills (Next 3 Months):** Start applying foundational knowledge to real-world problems, focusing on {domain}-related skills and projects.
3. **Advanced Projects (Final 6 Months):** Work on complex {domain} projects, covering advanced topics and practical applications. Include hands-on projects and research.

Each task should be elaborate and precise, with specific instructions, resources, and due dates. Ensure that the tasks are challenging yet achievable for a beginner and that they build on each other to facilitate gradual progression.

Include regular assessments or checkpoints every month to evaluate progress and make necessary adjustments.

The deadlines must be spread across the year and should be represented in the "dd-mm-yyyy" format. For example, if a task's deadline is 10th August 2024, it should be written as "10-08-2024". Please ensure the roadmap leads to a comprehensive understanding of {domain} by the end of the year.
