    Task Ordering: Determine the order in which tasks should be completed based on their type and due dates.
    Methodology:
    Prioritization: Prioritize tasks by their type (e.g., personal, work, study) and due dates.
    Task Breakdown: Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks if necessary.
    Execution: Provide a step-by-step method for tackling each task, ensuring productivity and efficiency.
    Provide the user with a clear and actionable plan that includes:

    A prioritized list of tasks with an explanation for their order.
    Specific steps for breaking down and completing each task.
    Any additional tips for maintaining focus and managing time effectively.

I want to become an expert in {domain} within a year. Currently, I am a beginner, and it is {today} today. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step, task-based roadmap that spans the entire year, starting from today, to help me achieve my goals in the {domain} domain.

The roadmap should include at least 50 tasks covering the entire year, organized into phases:

1. **Foundational Concepts (First 3 Months):** Focus on building a strong understanding of the basics of {domain}.
2. **Intermediate Skills (Next 3 Months):** Start applying foundational knowledge to real-world problems, focusing on {domain}-related skills and projects.
3. **Advanced Projects (Final 6 Months):** Work on complex {domain} projects, covering advanced topics and practical applications. Include hands-on projects and research.

Each task should be elaborate and precise, with specific instructions, resources, and due dates. Ensure that the tasks are challenging yet achievable for a beginner and that they build on each other to facilitate gradual progression.

Include regular assessments or checkpoints every month to evaluate progress and make necessary adjustments.

The deadlines must be spread across the year and should be represented in the "dd-mm-yyyy" format. For example, if a task's deadline is 10th August 2024, it should be written as "10-08-2024". Please ensure the roadmap leads to a comprehensive understanding of {domain} by the end of the year.

def FirstNote():
    return """### Welcome to Your First Note!

Hey there! üåü You've just unlocked the ultimate note-taking platform. Whether you're here to jot down ideas, manage your tasks, or explore new resources, you're in the right place.

Take a moment to explore and get comfy. We‚Äôve got some cool features to help you out:

<br>

#### **Special Slash Commands** üöÄ
- **`/manage my deadlines`**: Feeling overwhelmed? Use this command to stay on top of your deadlines like a pro!
- **`/youtube resources: <domain>`**: Need to dive into a topic? Fetch the best YouTube resources for any domain with just a slash.
- **`/roadmap: <domain>`**: Want to master something? Generate a year-round plan tailored to your goals.

These commands can be accessed via the chatbot available throughout the app.

<br>

#### **How to Use Markdown** üìù

Here's a quick visual guide on how you can make your notes more engaging with markdown:

<br>

1. **Creating Headers**:  
   Use different levels of headers to organize your content. For example:  
   ```markdown
   # Header 1
   ## Header 2
   ### Header 3
   ```
   This will create a hierarchy of headings.

<br>

2. **Making Text Bold or Italic**: 

   - To **bold** text, use double asterisks or underscores: 
     ```markdown
     **This text is bold**
     __This text is also bold__
     ```

   - To *italicize* text, use single asterisks or underscores:  
     ```markdown
     *This text is italic*
     _This text is also italic_
     ```

<br>

3. **Creating Lists**:  

   - **Unordered Lists**: Use asterisks, pluses, or dashes.  
     ```markdown
     * Item 1
     * Item 2
     ```

   - **Ordered Lists**: Just start with numbers.  
     ```markdown
     1. First item
     2. Second item
     ```

<br>

4. **Adding Links**:  

   You can add links like this:  
   ```markdown
   [Link Text](http://example.com)
   ```

<br>

5. **Adding an Image or GIF**:  

   ![My First Image Hooray](https://media.tenor.com/Iccl_wfwIdwAAAAM/despicable-me-minions.gif)  

   Simply use the format:  
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](image_url)
   ```

<br>

6. **Inserting Code Blocks**:  

   For inline code, use backticks:  
   ```markdown
   `This is inline code`
   ```

   For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks:  
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

<br>

7. **Adding Color to Text** üé®  

   You can add color to your text to make it stand out. You can use plain text color names like 'red', 'green', 'blue', etc., or use hex codes or RGB values. For example:  
   ```markdown
   <span style="color: red;">This text is red</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="color: #3498db;">This text is blue (using hex code)</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="color: rgb(255,165,0);">This text is orange (using RGB)</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   ```

   **This will be seen as follows:**

   <span style="color: red;">This text is red</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="color: #3498db;">This text is blue</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="color: rgb(255,165,0);">This text is orange</span>. But this text is plain <br>

<br>

8. **Highlighting Text** üí°  

   Just like text coloring, you can highlight text with different colors. Use plain text names, hex codes, or RGB values for the highlight color. For example:  
   ```markdown
   <span style="background-color: #FF9FAE;">This text is highlighted in pink</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #FDE995;">This text is highlighted in yellow</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #A6E1C5;">This text is highlighted in light green</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #A7E0F6;">This text is highlighted in light blue</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #E1A7FB;">This text is highlighted in light purple</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   ```

   **This will be seen as follows:**

   <span style="background-color: #FF9FAE;">This text is highlighted in pink</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #FDE995;">This text is highlighted in yellow</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #A6E1C5;">This text is highlighted in light green</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #A7E0F6;">This text is highlighted in light blue</span>. But this text is plain <br>
   <span style="background-color: #E1A7FB;">This text is highlighted in light purple</span>. But this text is plain <br>

<br>

   **Sample Highlight Color Palette:**

   - Pink: `#FF9FAE`
   - Yellow: `#FDE995`
   - Light Green: `#A6E1C5`
   - Light Blue: `#A7E0F6`
   - Light Purple: `#E1A7FB`

<br>

**Note:**  
The `<br>` tag is used to add line breaks. It may be thought of as an `Enter` Key's Equivalent. Another Important element in markdown is the `---` which creates a horizontal line so as to provide sections in your notes.

<br>

#### **Putting It All Together**:
Combine these elements to create notes that are both functional and visually appealing.

<br>

This is just the beginning‚Äîthere‚Äôs so much more to discover. Happy noting! ‚ú®
